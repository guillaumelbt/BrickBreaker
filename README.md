# GPU Compute Shader Brick Breaker

## Overview

This repository contains a small student project focused on exploring and learning the capabilities of GPU Compute Shaders in Unity. The project is a modern twist on the classic Brick Breaker game, designed not just as a game but as a learning tool and portfolio piece to demonstrate advanced graphical programming techniques.

## Project Goals

- **Understanding Compute Shaders:** Dive deep into how Compute Shaders can be utilized in Unity for physics and complex calculations.
- **Efficient Collision Detection:** Implement and understand efficient collision detection and response algorithms using the GPU.
- **Learning by Doing:** Use a practical project to explore advanced graphics programming concepts.

## Game Description

The project simulates a Brick Breaker game where players control a paddle to hit a ball towards a layer of bricks. The objective is to break all the bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle. This simple gameplay is used as a canvas to apply and demonstrate Compute Shader applications in Unity.

## How to Interact

- **Control the Paddle:** Use keyboard arrow keys or mouse movement to move the paddle horizontally.
- **Break Bricks:** Aim to break all the bricks using the ball. Each brick might require multiple hits to break.
